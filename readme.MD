# Microservice Design Documentation

This documentation describes the design of a full‐stack microservice that exposes two endpoints:

-   **POST /data** – Accepts, validates, and persists JSON input.
-   **GET /data** – Retrieves and returns stored data.

**Performance Goals:**

-   Both read and write operations should respond within 500ms.
-   The service must scale to millions (or billions) of records with minimal (<10%) performance degradation.
-   It must support high scalability for unique users.

My design emphasizes security, scalability, containerization, and DevOps best practices, drawing inspiration from the strategies used by big tech companies.

## 1. High-Level Architecture

### 1.1 Architectural Overview

The system is organized into three distinct layers:

-   **API Layer:** Handles incoming HTTP requests (routing, authentication, validation) and forwards them to the service layer.
-   **Service Layer:** Contains business logic (e.g., validating JSON, enforcing domain rules) and coordinates with the persistence layer.
-   **Database Layer:** Responsible for data persistence. For this design, we choose a NoSQL solution like MongoDB (or a horizontally scalable RDBMS such as PostgreSQL) because of its ease of horizontal scaling and high write throughput, as demonstrated by big tech practices at Amazon and Netflix.

            +-----------------------+
            |      API Layer        |
            |  (REST endpoints,     |
            |   request validation) |
            +-----------+-----------+
                        |
                        v
            +-----------------------+
            |    Service Layer      |
            | (Business logic,      |
            |  data orchestration)  |
            +-----------+-----------+
                        |
                        v
            +-----------------------+
            |   Database Layer      |
            | (NoSQL/SQL Database   |
            |  with sharding for    |
            |  scalability)         |
            +-----------------------+
_Rationale:_ Separating concerns across layers promotes maintainability and scalability. This approach is widely used in systems developed by Netflix and Capital One, where each layer can be scaled and secured independently. [SINFORM](https://www.simform.com/blog/microservice-best-practices/)

## 2. Detailed Component Design

### 2.1 API Layer

-   **Responsibilities:**
    
    -   Expose HTTP endpoints (POST /data, GET /data).
    -   Validate JSON payloads (using JSON schema validators).
    -   Handle authentication (JWT tokens via an API Gateway or middleware).
    -   Return standardized responses and error messages.
-   **Best Practices:**
    
    -   Use a lightweight framework (e.g., Express.js for Node.js or FastAPI for Python).
    -   Integrate API Gateway functionality for rate limiting and centralized security checks.
    -   Follow RESTful conventions(use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-based URLs (e.g., /users/{id}), plural nouns for collections (/products), stateless interactions, proper HTTP status codes, versioning (e.g., /api/v1), filtering/sorting via query params, JSON/XML formats, HATEOAS (hypermedia links), and HTTPS security).

### 2.2 Service Layer

-   **Responsibilities:**
    -   Implement business rules (input validation beyond schema, transformation, logging).
    -   Interact with the database layer via a data access abstraction.
    -   Maintain transactional integrity and implement caching if needed.
-   **Best Practices:**
    -   Follow SOLID principles to keep components decoupled and testable.
    -   Use domain-driven design (DDD) to define bounded contexts.
    -   Design for idempotency and stateless processing to ease horizontal scaling.
-   **Trade-Offs:**
    -   Additional abstraction increases initial complexity but pays off in maintenance and scalability over time.

### 2.3 Database Layer

-   **Choice & Rationale:**
    -   **Option 1: NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB):** Ideal for rapid writes and horizontal scaling; used by many modern microservices.
    -   **Option 2: Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL):** Offers strong consistency and ACID transactions; can be horizontally scaled using sharding.For this challenge, MongoDB is selected to meet high data volume and scalability requirements.

## 3. Containerization & Docker
### 3.1 Dockerization Process

Containerizing the microservice guarantees consistent environments from development to production. The following best practices are applied:

-   **Use Minimal Base Images:** For example, use Alpine Linux to reduce the attack surface and image size.
-   **Multi-Stage Builds:** Separate the build and runtime environments to optimize the final image.
-   **Avoid Hardcoding:** Externalize configuration using environment variables and secret management.
-   **Security:** Run containers as non-root, implement vulnerability scanning, and sign images.

### 3.2 Sample Dockerfile

    # Build Stage
    FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm ci --only=production
    COPY . .
    RUN npm run build
    
    # Runtime Stage
    FROM node:18-alpine
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
    COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
    RUN npm ci --only=production --production
    EXPOSE 3000
    CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]

_Explanation:_
-   The multi-stage build minimizes the final image size by excluding build tools.
-   The image is based on a minimal Node.js Alpine image for better security and performance.

## 4. Kubernetes Deployment

### 4.1 Deployment Process

Deploy the containerized microservice to a Kubernetes cluster (using a managed service like AKS, EKS, or GKE). Key components include:

-   **Deployment:** Manages replica sets and pod lifecycles.
-   **Service:** Exposes the microservice via ClusterIP (internally) or LoadBalancer (externally).
-   **ConfigMap & Secret:** Manage configuration and sensitive data.
-   **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):** Automatically scales pods based on CPU/memory or custom metrics.

### 4.2 Sample Kubernetes Manifests

#### Deployment YAML

    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: data-microservice
      labels:
        app: data-microservice
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: data-microservice
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: data-microservice
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: data-microservice
            image: your-registry/data-microservice:latest
            ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
            envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: data-microservice-config
            - secretRef:
                name: data-microservice-secrets
            readinessProbe:
              httpGet:
                path: /health
                port: 3000
              initialDelaySeconds: 5
              periodSeconds: 10
            livenessProbe:
              httpGet:
                path: /health
                port: 3000
              initialDelaySeconds: 15
              periodSeconds: 20

#### Service YAML

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: data-microservice-svc
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      selector:
        app: data-microservice
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 3000

#### ConfigMap YAML

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: data-microservice-config
    data:
      NODE_ENV: production
      DB_CONNECTION_STRING: "mongodb://your-mongo-db:27017/datadb"

_Scalability Consideration:_ Horizontal Pod Autoscaling can be added by monitoring custom metrics to maintain the sub-500ms response time even under high load.

       [Pod1]  [Pod2]   [Pod3]   ... (autoscaled)  

_Explanation:_  
The Ingress routes external traffic to the Service, which forwards requests to the pods managed by the Deployment. Horizontal autoscaling ensures additional pods are spun up as needed.

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline

### 5.1 Pipeline Overview

A robust CI/CD pipeline automates code integration, testing, container image building, and Kubernetes deployment. Key steps include:

1.  **Code Integration:** Run linting and unit tests.
2.  **Build Stage:** Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile.
3.  **Push Stage:** Push the image to a container registry.
4.  **Deployment Stage:** Apply Kubernetes manifests to update the cluster.
5.  **Monitoring:** Automated health checks and rollback strategies.

### 5.2 Sample GitHub Actions Workflow
    name: CI/CD Pipeline
    
    on:
      push:
        branches: [ main ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]
    
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
        - name: Setup Node.js
          uses: actions/setup-node@v3
          with:
            node-version: '18'
    
        - name: Install dependencies and run tests
          run: |
            npm ci
            npm test
    
        - name: Build Docker image
          run: |
            docker build -t your-registry/data-microservice:latest .
    
        - name: Login to Docker Hub
          uses: docker/login-action@v2
          with:
            username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
            password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
    
        - name: Push Docker image
          run: |
            docker push your-registry/data-microservice:latest
    
      deploy:
        needs: build
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
        - name: Set up kubectl
          uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3
          with:
            version: 'latest'
    
        - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
          run: |
            kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
            kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml

_Explanation:_  
This workflow uses GitHub Actions to automate testing, Docker image build/push, and deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.

## 6. Testing Strategy
### 6.1 Testing Levels
**Unit Tests:**
Test individual functions and modules in isolation (e.g., JSON validation logic, business rules).
Coverage Goal: Aim for 80–90% coverage on critical components.

**Integration Tests:**
Test interactions between the API layer, service layer, and database (using a staging database or mocks).
Coverage Goal: Cover all critical service interactions and API endpoints.

**Performance Tests:**
Validate that API endpoints respond within 500ms under expected load using tools such as JMeter or k6.

### 6.2 Test Pyramid Diagram (ASCII)

      +---------------------+
      |   End-to-End Tests  |
      +---------------------+
              ^
      +---------------------+
      | Integration Tests   |
      +---------------------+
              ^
      +---------------------+
      |    Unit Tests       |
      +---------------------+

_Explanation:_  
Emphasize a large suite of fast unit tests, a moderate number of integration tests, and a few end-to-end tests for full system validation.


## 7. Future Roadmap & Optimizations

-   **Caching:**  
    Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load and improve response times.
    
-   **Service Mesh Integration:**  
    Evaluate using a service mesh (e.g., Istio) for better inter-service communication, traffic management, and enhanced security.
    
-   **Cost Analysis:**  
    Conduct an in-depth cost analysis for cloud deployment on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, focusing on auto-scaling, managed Kubernetes services, and container registries.
    
-   **Enhanced Observability:**  
    Integrate distributed tracing (using Jaeger or Zipkin) and advanced monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) to quickly diagnose performance issues.
    
-   **Security Enhancements:**  
    Regular vulnerability scanning and adopting best practices for container and API security, as practiced by companies like Capital One and Netflix.
